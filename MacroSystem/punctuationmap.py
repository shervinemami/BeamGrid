# coding: utf-8
# Dictionary of my non-alphabet keyboard mappings, ie: for punctuation and similar letters that exist on the keyboard but aren't in the English alphabet.
# Saying the phrase on the left should generate the symbol on the right.
# Symbols that are easier to say should be placed in the top of the list, since some screens won't need to show the symbols on the bottom of the list.
# Order is preserved, since we use the order as the way to find the index that directly controls the mouse position.
